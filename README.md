# Introduction 

This is a template application for integration applications. The application contains all required files ready for deployment to Common Swarm environment. The only things missing are Jenkins jobs.

# Getting Started

The application is already compiled so you can start the sample by launching the program from Run and Debug "tab"

# Build and Test

Bulding can be done by running

```
npm run build
```

or if continuous build is wanted

```
npm run build-continuous
```

To run the unit tests, just launch Mocha Tests from the Run and Debug.

# Now what?

Remove all the things you don't need and continue within the remaining application.
